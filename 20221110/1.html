The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is the world's dominant software platform.[1] It was
originally a hypertext document management system[2] accessed over the Internet.[3]
The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by
a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext documents formatted in
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Special HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs, which permits users
to navigate to other web resources. In addition to text, web pages may contain references to images, video, audio, and

<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" title="HTML5 specification">Hypertext Markup
Language(HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web
applications.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
appearance of the document.</p>

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are
delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
